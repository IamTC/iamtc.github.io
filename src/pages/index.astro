      <p class="info">
        In 2009 after modifying Need for Speed Hot Pursuit 2
        files to make cars go faster I fell in love with coding. First played around Visual Basic 
        and today I have experience working with a number of different technologies. I have worked with 
        software and Fintech companies building Fintech solutions. I also work as a 
        freelancer in my free time building solutions from ecommerce to messaging 
        platforms.
      </p>

      <p class="info">
        I currently am working on a Fintech solution that is focused on allowing users 
        to manage their budget. I am a huge admirrer of accessible UI designs and building
        software that looks good and accessible is something I truly enjoy.

        If I am not at the computer, you can find me attending my Bonsai trees, Hiking 
        a mountain, or playing with my camera.
